  Lemma fn_lookup_insert (f : A → T) a t : <[a:=t]>f a = t.
  Proof. unfold insert, fn_insert. by destruct (decide (a = a)). Qed.
  Lemma fn_lookup_insert_rev  (f : A → T) a t1 t2 :
    <[a:=t1]>f a = t2 → t1 = t2.
  Proof. rewrite fn_lookup_insert. congruence. Qed.
  Lemma fn_lookup_insert_ne (f : A → T) a b t : a ≠ b → <[a:=t]>f b = f b.
  Proof. unfold insert, fn_insert. by destruct (decide (a = b)). Qed.

  Lemma fn_lookup_alter (g : T → T) (f : A → T) a : alter g a f a = g (f a).
  Proof. unfold alter, fn_alter. by destruct (decide (a = a)). Qed.
  Lemma fn_lookup_alter_ne (g : T → T) (f : A → T) a b :
    a ≠ b → alter g a f b = f b.
  Proof. unfold alter, fn_alter. by destruct (decide (a = b)). Qed.
